# Booking Workflow Fixes - October 13, 2025

## Problems Identified

### 1. Duplicate Streaming Issue
**Symptom**: Every response was being streamed twice to the frontend, causing duplicate messages to appear.

**Root Cause**: There was a duplicated `should_use_calendar` method in `agent.py` (lines 77-100 and lines 101-125). This caused the routing logic to execute twice, leading to duplicate processing and streaming.

### 2. Booking State Not Preserved
**Symptom**: 
- Logs showed "📊 No incoming booking_state" on every request
- "🔄 Fetching new available slots..." happened repeatedly
- The workflow restarted from scratch instead of continuing from selection/confirmation steps
- Users couldn't complete bookings because the state was lost between requests

**Root Cause**: The booking state preservation logic was incomplete. While the state was being passed from frontend → backend → agent, the routing logic wasn't properly detecting ongoing booking sessions.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Removed Duplicate Method
**File**: `KKUCAssistant/backend/app/agent.py`

Removed the first incomplete `should_use_calendar` method (lines 77-100) and kept only the complete version that includes:
- Booking state checking
- Numeric input detection (1-5 for slot selection)
- Confirmation input detection (ja/nej/yes/no)
- LLM-based intent classification

### Fix 2: Enhanced Routing Logic
**File**: `KKUCAssistant/backend/app/agent.py`

Added intelligent detection for ongoing booking sessions:

```python
# If user types a number 1-5, they're likely selecting a slot
if user_input.strip().isdigit() and 1 <= int(user_input.strip()) <= 5:
    print(f"🗓️  Detected numeric input ({user_input.strip()}) - routing to calendar")
    return "calendar"

# If user types ja/nej, they're likely confirming
if user_input.lower().strip() in ["ja", "nej", "yes", "no", "y", "n", "ok", "bekræft"]:
    print(f"🗓️  Detected confirmation input ({user_input.strip()}) - routing to calendar")
    return "calendar"
```

This ensures that:
1. When a user has an active booking session (step="select" or "confirm"), the system routes to calendar
2. When a user types a number (1-5), it's recognized as slot selection and routes to calendar
3. When a user types confirmation words, it's recognized as confirmation and routes to calendar

### Fix 3: Server-Side State Management
**File**: `KKUCAssistant/frontend/app/api/chat/route.ts`

Implemented server-side booking state storage to persist state between requests:

```typescript
// Store booking state in memory
const bookingStateStore = new Map<string, any>();

// Intercept booking_state from backend stream
const match = chunk.match(/2:(\[.*?\])/);
if (match) {
  const bookingData = JSON.parse(match[1]);
  if (Array.isArray(bookingData) && bookingData[0]?.step) {
    bookingStateStore.set(sid, bookingData[0]);
  }
}
```

This ensures:
1. Booking state is captured from the backend response stream
2. State is stored server-side and automatically included in subsequent requests
3. No client-side state management complexity

### Fix 4: Simplified Frontend
**File**: `KKUCAssistant/frontend/components/MyAssistant.tsx`

Removed complex client-side state management since it's now handled server-side.

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Booking Flow:
1. **User**: "nogle ledige tider i morgen?"
   - System fetches slots and shows list
   - State: `step="select"`, `available_slots=[...]`

2. **User**: "1" (selects first slot)
   - System detects numeric input → routes to calendar
   - Uses existing booking_state with available slots
   - Processes selection and asks for confirmation
   - State: `step="confirm"`, `selected_slot={...}`

3. **User**: "ja" (confirms)
   - System detects confirmation input → routes to calendar
   - Uses existing booking_state with selected slot
   - Books the appointment
   - State: `step="complete"`, `booking_result={...}`

### No More Duplicate Streaming:
- Each request is processed once
- Each response is streamed once
- Clean, single output to the user

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Complete Booking Flow**:
   ```
   User: "book en tid"
   → Should show available slots
   User: "1"
   → Should ask for confirmation
   User: "ja"
   → Should confirm booking with details
   ```

2. **Verify No Duplicates**:
   - Check that each message appears only once in the UI
   - Check logs to ensure no duplicate processing

3. **Verify State Preservation**:
   - Check logs for "📊 Incoming booking_state: step=select" (not "No incoming booking_state")
   - Verify slots aren't fetched multiple times
   - Confirm booking completes successfully
