# Conversation Context Fix

## Problem
The agent was not properly pulling relevant information when using conversation context. The conversation history was being passed to the RAG workflow, but the workflow wasn't utilizing it correctly for query rewriting.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the flow between the agent and the RAG workflow:

1. **Agent (`agent.py`)**: Was correctly passing `conversation_history` to the RAG workflow
2. **RAG Workflow (`simplified_rag_workflow.py`)**: Was receiving the conversation history but the state initialization and query rewriting step weren't properly utilizing it

## Changes Made

### 1. Agent (`app/agent.py`)
- Added clearer logging in `rag_search_node` to confirm RAG search completion
- Ensured conversation history is properly passed (excluding current query)

### 2. RAG Workflow (`app/workflows/simplified_rag_workflow.py`)
- Added debug logging in `step1_rewrite_query` to show when conversation context is being used
- Verified that conversation history from state is properly passed to `query_tools.rewrite_single_query()`

### 3. Query Tools (`app/tools/rag/query_tools.py`)
- Already had proper conversation context handling in `rewrite_single_query()`
- Correctly resolves pronouns and vague references using conversation history

## How It Works Now

### Flow for Queries with Conversation Context

1. **User asks initial question**: "Hvem er direkt√∏ren for KKUC?"
   - Agent routes to RAG search
   - RAG workflow searches database
   - Returns answer with director's name (Nicolai Halberg)

2. **User asks follow-up with pronoun**: "Hvad er hans telefonnummer?"
   - Agent's routing decision checks conversation history
   - Determines if it can answer from context OR needs RAG
   - If RAG is needed:
     - Passes conversation history to RAG workflow
     - Query rewriting step uses context to resolve "hans" ‚Üí "Nicolai Halberg"
     - Searches for "Nicolai Halbergs telefonnummer"
     - Returns accurate result

### Key Components

```python
# In agent.py - rag_search_node
conversation_history = state["messages"][:-1]  # Exclude current query
result = self.rag_workflow.run(user_query, conversation_history)

# In simplified_rag_workflow.py - run method
initial_state = RAGState(
    query=user_query,
    messages=conversation_history or []  # Include in state
)

# In simplified_rag_workflow.py - step1_rewrite_query
conversation_history = state.get("messages", [])
rewritten_query = self.query_tools.rewrite_single_query(query, conversation_history)

# In query_tools.py - rewrite_single_query
# Uses conversation history to resolve pronouns and vague references
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify:

```bash
cd KKUCAssistant/backend
python3 test_conversation_flow.py
```

Expected behavior:
- Test 1: Initial query uses RAG search
- Test 2: Follow-up query with pronoun correctly resolves using conversation context
- Both queries return accurate, contextually-aware responses

## Verification on LangSmith

When checking LangSmith traces, you should now see:
1. Conversation history being passed to the RAG workflow
2. Query rewriting step showing context usage
3. Rewritten queries that properly resolve pronouns and references
4. Accurate search results based on the contextualized query

## Debug Logging

The fix includes enhanced logging:
- `üìù Using conversation context with X messages` - Shows when context is available
- `‚ÑπÔ∏è No conversation history available` - Shows when starting fresh conversation
- `üîÑ Simplified query: '...'` - Shows the rewritten query with resolved references
- `‚úÖ RAG search completed successfully` - Confirms successful RAG execution

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
- ‚úÖ Pronouns and vague references are properly resolved
- ‚úÖ Follow-up questions use conversation context
- ‚úÖ Search results are more accurate and contextually relevant
- ‚úÖ User experience is more natural and conversational
