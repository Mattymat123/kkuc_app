# State Management Refactor - LangGraph Platform Integration

## Overview

This document describes the complete refactor of the KKUC Assistant's state management system to use LangGraph Platform best practices with proper checkpointing and interrupt handling.

## What Changed

### Before (Old System)
- ❌ Manual `booking_state` management in memory Map
- ❌ Custom streaming logic in route.ts
- ❌ State lost on server restart
- ❌ No proper human-in-the-loop support
- ❌ Complex state synchronization between frontend/backend

### After (New System)
- ✅ LangGraph `MemorySaver` checkpointing
- ✅ Built-in `interrupt()` for human-in-the-loop
- ✅ Thread-based state persistence
- ✅ Simplified streaming with FastAPI
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns

## Architecture Changes

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Agent (`agent.py`)
- **Added**: `MemorySaver` checkpointer for state persistence
- **Removed**: Manual `booking_state` management
- **Simplified**: State schema to only include `messages`
- **Changed**: Agent now compiles with checkpointer

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

checkpointer = MemorySaver()
agent_executor = agent.graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
```

#### 2. Calendar Workflow (`calendar_workflow.py`)
- **Added**: LangGraph `interrupt()` calls for human-in-the-loop
- **Removed**: Manual step tracking ("select", "confirm", etc.)
- **Changed**: Workflow now uses proper graph nodes with interrupts

**Interrupt Points:**
1. **Slot Selection**: Waits for user to select a time slot
2. **Booking Confirmation**: Waits for user to confirm booking

```python
from langgraph.types import interrupt

# Wait for user selection
selection = interrupt({
    "type": "slot_selection",
    "slots": slots_display,
    "message": "Vælg venligst et nummer"
})

# Wait for confirmation
confirmed = interrupt({
    "type": "booking_confirmation",
    "slot": selected_slot,
    "message": "Bekræft booking"
})
```

#### 3. Server (`server.py`)
- **Added**: Thread-based endpoints compatible with LangGraph SDK
  - `POST /threads/{thread_id}/runs/stream` - Stream a run
  - `POST /threads/{thread_id}/runs` - Resume from interrupt
  - `GET /threads/{thread_id}/state` - Get thread state
- **Kept**: Legacy `/chat` endpoint for backward compatibility
- **Changed**: Streaming format to Server-Sent Events (SSE)

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Route Handler (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- **Removed**: `bookingStateStore` Map
- **Removed**: Custom state management logic
- **Simplified**: Now just proxies to backend
- **Removed**: Complex stream transformation

#### 2. MyAssistant Component (Ready for Migration)
The component currently uses `@assistant-ui/react-data-stream` but is ready to migrate to `@langchain/langgraph-sdk/react` when needed.

**Future Migration Path:**
```typescript
import { useStream } from "@langchain/langgraph-sdk/react";

const stream = useStream({
  apiUrl: "http://localhost:8000",
  assistantId: "agent",
  threadId: threadId,
  onThreadId: setThreadId,
  messagesKey: "messages",
  reconnectOnMount: true,
});

// Handle interrupts
if (stream.interrupt) {
  return <InterruptUI interrupt={stream.interrupt} onResume={stream.submit} />;
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. Thread-Based Conversations

Each conversation is now associated with a **thread ID**:
- Thread ID is generated on first message
- State is persisted per thread using checkpointer
- Can resume conversations after page refresh
- Multiple conversations can exist simultaneously

### 2. Checkpointing

The `MemorySaver` checkpointer:
- Saves state after each node execution
- Stores state in memory (lost on server restart)
- Can be upgraded to PostgreSQL/SQLite for persistence
- Enables time-travel debugging

### 3. Interrupts (Human-in-the-Loop)

Interrupts pause execution and wait for user input:

**Flow:**
1. Workflow reaches `interrupt()` call
2. Execution pauses, state is saved
3. Frontend receives interrupt event
4. User provides input
5. Frontend calls resume endpoint
6. Workflow continues from checkpoint

**Example Booking Flow:**
```
User: "Book en tid"
  ↓
Agent: Fetches available slots
  ↓
[INTERRUPT: slot_selection]
  ↓
User: Selects slot #2
  ↓
[RESUME with selection]
  ↓
[INTERRUPT: booking_confirmation]
  ↓
User: Confirms "ja"
  ↓
[RESUME with confirmation]
  ↓
Agent: Books appointment
```

## Benefits

### 1. State Persistence
- State survives page refreshes
- Can resume interrupted workflows
- No data loss during execution

### 2. Simplified Code
- Removed ~100 lines of custom state management
- No manual state synchronization
- Built-in error handling

### 3. Better UX
- Users can refresh page without losing progress
- Clear interrupt points for confirmations
- Consistent state across sessions

### 4. Maintainability
- Follows LangGraph best practices
- Easier to debug with checkpoints
- Standard patterns for human-in-the-loop

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

**Current State:**
- Backend is fully migrated ✅
- Frontend still uses old system (works with legacy endpoint)
- Both systems work simultaneously

**To Complete Migration:**
1. Update `MyAssistant.tsx` to use `useStream()`
2. Create interrupt UI components
3. Remove legacy `/chat` endpoint
4. Test thoroughly

### Testing

**Backend Testing:**
```bash
# Test thread creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/threads/test-123/runs/stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {"messages": [{"type": "human", "content": "book en tid"}]}}'

# Test resume
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/threads/test-123/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command": {"resume": 1}}'
```

**Frontend Testing:**
1. Start backend: `cd backend && python -m app.server`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Test booking flow
4. Verify state persistence

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: State Not Persisting
**Solution**: Ensure checkpointer is properly configured in agent.py

### Issue: Interrupts Not Working
**Solution**: Check that calendar_workflow.py uses `interrupt()` correctly

### Issue: Frontend Not Receiving Interrupts
**Solution**: Verify server.py streams interrupt events in SSE format

## Future Enhancements

1. **Database Checkpointing**: Upgrade from MemorySaver to PostgreSQL
2. **Thread Management UI**: Show list of active conversations
3. **Branching**: Allow users to edit previous messages
4. **Analytics**: Track interrupt acceptance rates

## Conclusion

This refactor modernizes the KKUC Assistant's state management to use industry-standard LangGraph patterns. The system is now more robust, maintainable, and provides better user experience with proper state persistence and human-in-the-loop support.
